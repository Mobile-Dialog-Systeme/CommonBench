# CommonBench

This is a Benmark Dataset based on  Mozilla Common Voice (MCV)

## Download
To download the MCV-Dataset you can use the download_data.py script. While it makes the process easier, currently there is no way to directly download the entire dataset at once. For every Language there is a separate download link you can only access when providing your e-mail and agreeing to the terms and conditions.
You can copy these individual links into the download script. Which downloads the splits in sequence and unpacks them afterwards. 

Make sure you have enough disk-space on your device. The entire unzipped 16.1 set comprises about 725Gb
